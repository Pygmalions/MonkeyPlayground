The mdns library is an optional dependency, which is included for this example only. The mdns library has been modified
slightly to work with unity (mostly logging adjustments).

The newest version of the library can be acquired here: https://github.com/richardschneider/net-mdns
The license is MIT.

If you don't want to include the dead zip in your project, just remove the example directory from the project.

Follow these steps to activate this example:
* Unzip the mdns.zip and put it in your project
* ExampleMDNSController, uncomment the `#define MDNS` line to activate the example
* Make sure that the SERVER GameObject has the `ExampleMDNSController`
* After starting, the MDNS discovery takes time
    * If there are exceptions like `Insecure connection not allowed`, please make sure that the player settings "Allow downloads over HTTP*"
